          Dear [Manager&apos;s Name],
          <br />I hope you are doing well. Below is my progress update on
          Project X:

            <li>We have completed the initial research phase.</li>
            <li>
              The team has started designing the prototypes for the new product.
            </li>
            <li>
              We have received positive feedback from the client regarding the
              initial concept.

          <ul className='list-disc pl-5 text-gray-700'>
            <li>
              We faced a delay in receiving some important data from the
              supplier, which set us back by 2 days.
            </li>
            <li>
              There are still some unresolved technical issues with the design.
              We are working closely with the engineering team to address this.

          <ul className='list-disc pl-5 text-gray-700'>
            <li>
              We plan to complete the final design and move to production by the
              end of next week.
            </li>
            <li>
              I will be meeting with the supplier on Monday to discuss the delay
              and ensure that it doesn&apos;t affect our timeline.
